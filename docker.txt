- Communication using ports between host->container and container->container (fig.yml):

gitlab:
  image: sameersbn/gitlab:7.6.0
  links:
   - redis:redisio
   - postgresql:postgresql
  ports:
   - "10080:80"
   - "10022:22"
  environment:
    - GITLAB_HTTPS=false
pymark:
  build: .
  command: /bin/start.sh
  volumes:
    - .:/code
  links:
    - gitlab
    - postgresql

The "ports" section on fig.yml as "10080:80" means the docker host will use port 10080 to communicate with the container, but the "pymark" container will communicate with the "gitlab" container through port 80, and NOT port 10080.
