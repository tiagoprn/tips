VPC

    - Create VPC:
        - Your VPCs, Create VPC
            - Name: Oregon VPC
            - CIDR BLock: 172.16.0.0/16 (class B VPC)

        VPC spans an entire AWS Region. 
        Ideally one VPC for Availability Zone. 

    - Create Subnet: 

        - Outside:
            - Name: Oregon Outside 2c ("2c" because it will sit on the availability zone 2c. Feel free to choose any other but stick to it). 
            - VPC: choose the one created on the previous step. 
            - Availability Zone: 2c
            - CIDR Block: 172.16.0.0/24 

        - Inside:
            - Name: Oregon Inside 2c ("2c" because it will sit on the availability zone 2c. Feel free to choose any other but stick to it). 
            - VPC: choose the one created on the previous step. 
            - Availability Zone: 2c
            - CIDR Block: 172.16.1.0/24         
        
        - Databases:
            - Name: Oregon Database 2c ("2c" because it will sit on the availability zone 2c. Feel free to choose any other but stick to it). 
            - VPC: choose the one created on the previous step. 
            - Availability Zone: 2c
            - CIDR Block: 172.16.2.0/24         
        
        - Applications:
            - Name: Oregon Applications 2c ("2c" because it will sit on the availability zone 2c. Feel free to choose any other but stick to it). 
            - VPC: choose the one created on the previous step. 
            - Availability Zone: 2c
            - CIDR Block: 172.16.3.0/24     

        - Core Services: 
            - Name: Oregon Core Services 2c ("2c" because it will sit on the availability zone 2c. Feel free to choose any other but stick to it). 
            - VPC: choose the one created on the previous step. 
            - Availability Zone: 2c
            - CIDR Block: 172.16.4.0/24     
            (here you could put a Domain Controller, Internal DNS Services, File sharing etc...)

        - WAN: 
            - Name: Oregon WAN 2c ("2c" because it will sit on the availability zone 2c. Feel free to choose any other but stick to it). 
            - VPC: choose the one created on the previous step. 
            - Availability Zone: 2c
            - CIDR Block: 172.16.5.0/24     
            (provides region to region conectivity between VPCs)

        VPN instances could be on the WAN subnet - or you could put the VPN instances on the Outside Subnet.

    - Internet Gateway: 
        Used by the VPCs to go to the internet.     

        - Create Internet Gateway: 
            Name: Oregon VPC IGW (Yes, Create)

        Then, click on it and "Attach to VPC". Attach it to the "Oregon VPC".

        Now the VPC has internet conectivity. 

    - Routing Tables: 
        We will creating a routing table to the "Outside" and "WAN" Subnets. 
        
        - Create Route Table
            - Name tag: Outside and WAN Internet Routing Table for 2c
            - VPC: Oregon VPC
            
            Click on the "Routes" Sheet of the route table. 
            It will just have one named "local".
            We will click "Edit", and configure it for the created instances to have access to the internet. 
            Add a new entry: 
                Destination: 0.0.0.0/0 ; Target: type "igw" and wait for it to auto-complete to the Internet Gateway we configured on the previous step. 
            Click "Save".

            Click on the "Subnet Associations" Sheet now. 
            Select on the "Associate" column the subnets "Oregon Outside 2c" and "Oregon WAN 2c" and click "Save". 


        - Also, with our route table created on the previous step (unlabelled), Amazon has auto-created one for us pointing the destination just to the VPC. 
          So, we can put a name tag on it as "Default Internal VPC Routing Table for 2c". 
          Also, click on its "Subnet Associations" Sheet and select the other subnets EXCEPT the Outside and WAN (since they are on the other routing table).
